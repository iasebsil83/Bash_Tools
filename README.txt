This repository is a bunch of a little tools that can
help you in a bash terminal.

It is compatible with all linux systems.
Requires only python3 for some tools.






I] Installation

Go to your home directory :
    > cd ~

Get the repository from GitHub :
    > git clone https://github.com/iasebsil83/Bash_Tools
    > mv Bash_Tools .bash_tools

Add the new folder to your PATH variable :
    > echo -e "\n\n\n# Bash tools by I.A. :\nPATH=\"\$PATH:$HOME/.bash_tools\"\n" >> .bashrc

There you go !






II] Use

Now, open a new terminal.
You should be able to run these new commands :

    - updateAll      (completely update & upgrade your packages and remove unnecessary files)
    - dev_finder     (detect the effects of a new device on your computer in /dev)
    - tput_allColors (shows the available colors in your terminal (tput dependant))
    - mtx_bin        (displays binary numbers randomly in the terminal)
    - mtx_hex        (same as mtx_bin but in hexadecimal)
